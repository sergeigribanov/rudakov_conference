abstract = {In this article, we discuss a new software package of kinematic and vertex fitting for the CMD-3 experiment at the VEPP-2000 electron-positron collider. The authors describe in detail the fitting algorithm, parametrization of four-momenta and trajectories of various particles and present the results of testing the fitting pakage using events of Monte Carlo simulation of various  e + e - annihilation processes. The authors also provide several examples of the fitting package validation using Gaussian simulation. Although the package discussed in this article is intended for the CMD-3 experiment, it can also be used in other experiments.  The authors consider the described package as their first step towards a more universal and rigorous kinematic and vertex fitting package that can be used in future e + e -  experiments, such as the Super Charm-Tau factory.}

abstract = {An account is given of the method of extended maximum likelihood. This differs from the standard method of maximum likelihood in that the normalisation of the probability distribution function is allowed to vary. It is thus applicable to problems in which the number of samples obtained is itself a relevant measurement. If the function is such that its size and shape can be independently varied, then the estimates given by the extended method are identical to the standard maximum likelihood estimators, though the errors require care of interpretation. If the function does not have this property, then extended maximum likelihood can give better results.}

title = {Kernel density estimation of a multidimensional efficiency profile},
journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {Kernel density estimation is a convenient way to estimate the probability density of a distribution    given the sample of data points. However, it has certain drawbacks:    proper description of the density using narrow kernels needs large data samples, whereas    if the kernel width is large, boundaries and narrow structures tend to be smeared.    Here, an approach to correct for such effects, is proposed that uses an approximate    density to describe narrow structures and boundaries. The approach is shown to be well suited for    the description of the efficiency shape over a multidimensional phase space    in a typical particle physics analysis. An example is given for the five-dimensional    phase space of the Λ0b → D0pπ− decay.}

title = {Model selection for amplitude analysis},
journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {Model complexity in amplitude analyses is often a priori under-constrained since the underlying theory permits a large number of possible amplitudes to contribute to most physical processes.   The use of an overly complex model results in reduced predictive power and worse resolution on unknown parameters of interest. Therefore, it is common to reduce the complexity by removing from consideration some subset of the allowed amplitudes. This paper studies a method for limiting model complexity from the data sample itself through regularization during regression in the context of  a multivariate (Dalitz-plot) analysis.   The regularization technique applied greatly improves the performance.   An outline of how to obtain the significance of a resonance in a multivariate amplitude analysis is also provided.}
